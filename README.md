# Martin's ArchLinux install for Nvidia

This script is my personal Arch Linux install script for Nvidia hardware.
It is still in works, the script is not complete yet and will NOT work as of now.

A little resume of my script:

- Single boot (it must NOT be used for dualbooting, it will erase your disk, you are warned)
- No swap
- System in American English with Swiss french keyboard
- Installs Intel ucode for Intel processors
- Installs Plasma KDE with a minimal amount of applications
- Uses Xorg X11 as wayland is still too unstable for Nvidia hardware

This install needs post, manual work for a fully installed setup.
It is not documented here because it is where the install becomes personalized to my hardware, and to me. 
To make simple, starting from now the commands you will be typing will probably be very different from mine.
